🚀 Just Completed an Exciting Project: Facial Recognition Attendance System! 🎯

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a comprehensive Facial Recognition Attendance System that combines cutting-edge AI with practical application in educational environments.

🔑 Key Features:
• Real-time facial recognition using DeepFace with MTCNN backend
• Role-based UI with Admin, Teacher, and Student dashboards
• Secure authentication system with password reset functionality
• Automated attendance tracking with database integration
• Professional GUI built with PyQt5 and modern design principles

🧠 Technical Highlights:
• Powered by TensorFlow and ResNet50 for robust face recognition
• OpenCV for computer vision tasks
• SQLite database for secure data storage
• Docker containerization for easy deployment
• Advanced model training with transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuning

🔧 Tech Stack:
• Python 3.9
• TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
• OpenCV for computer vision
• PyQt5 for desktop UI
• DeepFace for face detection and recognition
• Docker for containerization

This project demonstrates the power of combining machine learning with practical software engineering to solve real-world problems. The system can be easily adapted for various use cases beyond attendance tracking, such as access control or security systems.
